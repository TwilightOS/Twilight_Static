To get the best experience, open this up on a "Chromebook 3100 2-in-1".


Hover left of the browser to show the sidenav. 

You can:
  -Search for apps when you click on the circle at the top in the sidenav.
  -Open apps by clicking on them(only the browser, calculator, camera, and eaglercraft work for now).
  -Right-click on one of the apps to show a menu where you can open the app, uninstall the app, or get info about it(there is info for all the apps).
  -Click the text "TwilightOS" at the bottom right corner to reset the apps if you deleted to much of them.
